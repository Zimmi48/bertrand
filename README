This directory contains the proof of correctness of Knuth's algorithm
for prime numbers


It is composed of :

- A proof of correctness of the algorithm as described in 
    `The Art of Computer Programming: Fundamental Algorithms' by Knuth,
   pages 147-149 (Knuth.mlw).

- A proof of Bertrand's postulate: there always exists a prime between
  n  and 2n for n greater than 2 (Bertrand.v).

- A little program that generates a partition of 1..2n in pairs (i,j)
  such that i+j is always prime (run_partition.ml). 
  The proof of correctness of this program is a direct consequence of 
  Bertrand's postulate (Partition.v). This nice application of Bertrand's 
  postulate was suggested by Gerard Huet.

To build the directory, you must first download the WHY tool at

    http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/why/

and edit the first line of the file Make:

    WHYDIR = "/net/home/thery/soft/why-0.71/"

after this you should be able to compile the whole library with:
 
    make all

To run the program so to generate the partition for 1...100, do

    ocaml

    #use "run_partition.ml";;

    part 50;;
